End: Mon, 2 Feb 2015 2:00:00 -0800
Tasks: Check the HTML file to make sure it will interact correctly. Still attempting to create a working javascript file but it is slow going. I got a few functions in and then realized that the path I was working on was wrong so I pretty much had to start over. Submitted the HTML for the assignment but not the javascript file because it does not work.
